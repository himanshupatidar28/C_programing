# Authentication System in C

This is a simple authentication system implemented in C. It provides basic user authentication functionality, allowing users to log in with a username and password.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can log in with a username and password.
- **Password Encryption**: Passwords are stored securely by encrypting them before saving them to a file.
- **Error Handling**: Provides error handling for invalid login attempts.

## Usage

1. Compile the code using a C compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable file.
3. Enter the username and password when prompted.
4. If the credentials are correct, the system will grant access; otherwise, it will display an error message and prompt for credentials again.

## Implementation Details

- **User Data File**: User credentials (username and encrypted password) are stored in a text file named `users.txt`.
- **Login Process**: The system reads the username and password entered by the user and compares them with the credentials stored in the file.
- **Error Handling**: The system handles invalid login attempts by displaying appropriate error messages.

## Security Considerations

- **Password Encryption**: Ensure to use a secure encryption algorithm to encrypt passwords before storing them.
- **Access Control**: Implement proper access control measures to restrict unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
- **Secure Storage**: Store user credentials securely and protect the storage medium from unauthorized access.

## Note

- This authentication system is intended for educational purposes and may not have all the features of a production-level authentication system.
- For real-world applications, consider using established authentication frameworks or libraries that provide more robust security features.

## Disclaimer

This authentication system is provided as-is, without any warranty or guarantee of security. Use it responsibly and avoid using it for sensitive or production environments without proper evaluation and testing.
