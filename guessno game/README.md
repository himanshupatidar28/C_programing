2. Run the compiled executable file.
3. The game will prompt you to enter the range of numbers (minimum and maximum) within which the random number will be generated.
4. Once the range is specified, the game will ask you to guess the number.
5. You have a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number.
6. After each guess, the game will provide feedback whether the guessed number is too high or too low.
